# Projsync

I have a lot of software projects that I share across several computers.  I end up doing a lot of:
```
cd <project dir>
git fetch
git pull
```

for each of my projects.  ProjSync is a simple utility to automate syncing many projects with one command.


## Status

This is very much a work in progress at the moment and doesn't work yet.
